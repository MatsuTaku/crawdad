# ðŸ¦ž Crawdad: ChaRActer-Wise Double-Array Dictionary

Crawdad is a library of natural language dictionaries using character-wise double-array tries.
The implementation is optimized to CJK strings.

## What can do

- **Key-value mapping**: Crawdad stores a set of string keys with mapping arbitrary integer values.
- **Exact match**: Crawdad supports fast query to look up a given key.
- **Common prefix search**: Crawdad supports fast *common prefix search* that can be used to enumerate all keys appearing in a text.

## Data structures

Crawdad provides the three implementations:

- `crawdad::Trie` is a standard trie form.
- `crawdad::MpTrie` is the minimal-prefix trie.
- `crawdad::FmpTrie` is the minimal-prefix trie.
